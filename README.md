## Advanced NLP with spaCy 

[Course Website - English](https://course.spacy.io/en)

[Course's Source Code](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course)

This free course teaches you how to use [spaCy](spacy.io/), a natural language processing Python package. The chapters include the following:

1. **Finding words, phrases, names, and concepts**: Learn about documents, spans, tokens, lexical attributes, statistical models and their packages, predicting linguistic annotations and named entities in context, rule-based matching and the matcher, and writing packages.

2. **Large-scale data analysis**: Learn about spaCy's data structures, word vectors and semantics, debugging patterns, and phrase matching.

3. **Processing pipeline**: Learn about processing, inspecting, and customizing the pipeline; simple and complex components, setting extension attributes, scaling and performance, and processing streams.

4. **Training a neural network model**: Learn about creating training data, setting up the pipeline, building the training loop, and training multiple labels.

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks of the free course materials on spaCy's website, which is also available on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-nlp-with-spacy) as a certificate (but requires a subscription).
