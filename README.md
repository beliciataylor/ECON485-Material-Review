# Training
_Code used to improve skill-sets._

This repository contains code that I've used to develop my coding skills and be able to practice the techniques and skills needed to complete projects in my portfolio. I've provided explanations of each file and what you'd find.

## NLP Learning: from [_Text Analytics with Python_](https://www.amazon.com/Text-Analytics-Python-Practitioners-Processing/dp/1484243536/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/144-1875545-9407862?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1484243536&pd_rd_r=5e3ae205-4e46-4b1f-8323-c374ffbb7d93&pd_rd_w=I0iqB&pd_rd_wg=Cwn0e&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=Z454NVVRHP48CPMZACE5&psc=1&refRID=Z454NVVRHP48CPMZACE5)

This folder contains my typed-up chapter notes and codes from the _Text Analytics with Python: A Practitioner's Guide to Natural Language Processing_. Each chapter has a folder that contains Jupyter notebooks of the entire chapter and also Jupyter notebooks of each section of the chapter with my notes. I created the sections when I was reviewing the chapter notebook a second time. Each folder also contains the data used in each chapter and also saved models that were trained in order to avoid having to retrain the models each time I run the notebook. The folder handmade also contains modules needed in the chapters or modules that I made to make loading data between section notebooks easier.
